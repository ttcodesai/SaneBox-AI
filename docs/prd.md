### 4. Problem Statement

**Current Pain Points:**
- Inbox overload: promotional, notification, and spam emails obscure critical content.
- Manual unsubscribe is slow, error-prone, and tedious.
- Missing or delayed responses to important emails due to clutter.
- Anxiety or lost productivity from an unmanageable inbox.
- Lack of intelligent automation for organizing and prioritizing communication.

**Market Opportunity:**
- The global email users base exceeds 4 billion, with Gmail dominating consumer and SMB segments.
- The SaaS productivity tools market is rapidly expanding, with increasing demand for AI-driven automation.
- Current competitors (Unroll.me, Clean Email, etc.) lack advanced AI, customization, or are not privacy-first.

### 5. Solution Overview

**Core Features:**
- Gmail OAuth authentication and secure integration

- “Today’s Highlights” aggregation (user-customizable rules and AI summaries)
- Whitelist/blacklist management
- Minimalist web dashboard
- Privacy-first architecture (no data retained unless user consents)

**Prioritization:**
